Elephant: A Wellness Trunk is an extension/widget for laptops that acts as a reminder for users to take wellness breaks amidst tasks. These breaks will remind the user to perform wellness tasks such as stretching, drinking water, meditation, walking breaks, etc. Our target audience is people whose working needs are not met by existing products (e.g. pomodoro, to-do list), are encouraged by an aesthetic or gamified system, and want to incorporate more wellness into their working routine.
