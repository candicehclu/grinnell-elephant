## Elephant Manual App Testing Protocol

---

## Overview
This document shows the procedures for manually testing the Elephant app. The tests are performed by humans and verify that the UI works as expected. This protocol may replace the automated testing 
by testing UI transitions and functions that are not easily and readily testable via XCUI Tes,t and limited support for SwiftUI navigation behavior.
