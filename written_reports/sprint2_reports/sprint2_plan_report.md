# Sprint 2 Planning report

In this sprint, our team wants to begin more of the coding implementation of the project, transferring ideas from our paper prototype to the digital version of Elephant: A Wellness Trunk. We have discussed our previous task commitment and to meet our sprint retrospective goals, we aim to vary what each team member does this sprint and assign different tasks including documentation and sprint report writing, as well as coding specific features. For at least one of our team members, she'll be taking more responsibility with the sprint report and updating our requirements and repository since she doesn't have at-home access to a MacOS device at home to contribute to the initial coding assignments that we want to get started on. These will be equally divided upon return from break once everyone has the same access again. We estimate the time taken for each member to complete their tasks will be reported within our Trello tasks and checking on each other's progress, constantly asking for team feedback, through our Teams group chat.

Goals: Our goals this sprint is to focus more on the software implementation for Elephant, as described by our task breakdown below,
- Continue researching collectible systems examples/ideas
- Assign page/feature for each team member
- Create database of wellness tasks

Issue Tracker: How can your instructor view the results of your sprint planning using your issue tracker?
Make sure that issues within your issue tracker are well formed. A well formed issue is:
Well defined: includes a meaningful title and a description outlining the details of the issue
Scoped: has an estimate of the time or effort needed to complete
Verifiable: has a clear, unambiguous description of how to know when it is done
Indecomposable: can't be broken down into smaller parts that could stand on their own
Make sure that issues for this sprint can easily be seen in your issue tracker even after the end of the sprint.
