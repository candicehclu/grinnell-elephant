# Sprint 2 Planning report

**Capacity**

In this sprint, our team wants to begin more of the coding implementation of the project, transferring ideas from our paper prototype to the digital version of Elephant: A Wellness Trunk. We have discussed our previous task commitment and to meet our previous sprint retrospective goals, we aim to vary what each team member does this sprint and assign different tasks including documentation and sprint report writing, as well as coding specific features. 

For at least one of our team members, she'll be taking more responsibility with the sprint report and updating our requirements and repository since she doesn't have at-home access to a MacOS device at home to contribute to the initial coding assignments that we want to get started on. These will be equally divided upon return from break once everyone has the same access again. We estimate the time taken for each member to complete their tasks will be reported within our Trello tasks and checking on each other's progress, constantly asking for team feedback, through our Teams group chat. Compared to the previous sprint, we estimate our capacity at approximately *** hours per team member for this sprint, distributed across coding, documentation, and collaboration activities. These time estimates will be tracked and updated in Trello as tasks progress.

**Goals:** Our goal for this sprint is to focus more on the software implementation for Elephant, as described by our task breakdown below,
- Collect collectible images (assigned to all)
- Establish tokenized system (assigned to all)
- Assign page/feature for each team member
- Create database of wellness tasks
- Connect different pages within our repository
- Create database of images for collectibles
- Implement setting changes for color and text font
- Implement setting page for customizable checklist(s)
- Team Bonding!! <3 (assigned to all)

These goals contribute directly to our milestone of transitioning from prototype to initial implementation of key features. By focusing on coding tasks and integrating team feedback, we aim to establish a strong foundation for subsequent sprints.

**Assignment:**
During this sprint, our team decided that tasks would be divided up into the following roles but we want to emphasize that this is subject to change given team member's access and variation in work for that week. **This table does not mean each person is entitled to their role nor they should be the only one doing the task.** We should all collaborate to work on every task but this table shows who should lead each task since there are lots of tasks and assignments can be confusing.

| Role                         | Responsibilities |
|------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Project Manager (Hyeyun)**    | Oversees sprint progress and reports, manages deadlines/Trello board, organizes meetings, and ensures team coordination. |
| **Lead Developer (Candice)** | Oversees overall implementation, handles technical setup, coding standards, and supports development in Swift and Xcode. |
| **Lead Designer (Mae)** | Responsible for design-related tasks (e.g., character design, coloring, paper prototyping) and brainstorming app ideas. |
| **Documentation & Reporting Lead (Gabby)** | Reviews and updates sprint reports, maintains documentation, and ensures clear communication of progress (grammar, wording..etc..).  |

## Issue Tracker
1. We have shared our Trello Elephant Development Board with our instructor and mentor, assigning tasks to each team member with clear deadlines and there is an access link in our README file under written_reports.
2. We also have labels to categorize the tasks and label for the sprint for extra clarification. (ex: which task should be recorded in the sprint journal vs. the user requirement document)
3. The results of our sprint planning are tracked by our ‘Sprint2’ goals and transferred to ‘In progress’ once the task is picked up and moved over to ‘Done’ once completed.
4. For the tasks that cannot be proceeded by the dependencies such as tech access issues, those tasks are moved to the 'On Hold' list.
