# Sprint 2 Review

This sprint, we made a lot more progress on our sprint 2 goals and advanced in implementing the coding portion of our project.

### How has your product improved or progressed from a customer perspective? Describe high-level features that a non-technical user could recognize and appreciate.

  Coming up to the end of this sprint, our product progressed from the first bare version we had created in the previous sprint. We have been working on navigation connections and linking our app's pages, as well as the general layout, customizable user settings, and manual. From a customer's perspective, we have done more work on the initial implementation by focusing on user feedback from our last sprint, making it easy for users to interact with Elephant and test it out even now. We are currently working on the MVB for our upcoming in-class demo, but still have much to implement, including the digital avatars selection, because of our limitations with constructing a robust database without financial resources, and yet to commission an artist to work on them in tandem.

### What progress have you made that is not visible to a common user?

  To address concerns about commissioning an artist to create about 30 digital avatars, as well as Apple developer costs for when we end up publishing Elephant: A Wellness Trunk to the App Store, we have been working with the Wilson Catalyst program by pitching our project ideas for funding. Our team pitched Elephant to a group of Grinnell faculty and staff, and we were given really good feedback for further implementation. From this pitch, we gained some more user feedback from older demographics that asked us to consider implementing a more sustainable business model by incorporating a free trial and promotional merchandise for first-time users. We're feeling pretty good about this since the Dean of Res Life at Grinnell, one of the panel reviewers, suggested that the app could help first years in their transition to Grinnell since many have difficulty with time management and such, meaning that Elephant is meant to target these issues and make productivity and minfulness not only gamified and interesting, but also helpful to Grinnell college students in the long run, prolonging the lifespan of our app for the forseeable future.

### Additional Work

  We've met with Wilson Catalyst mentors to go through a demo of our app various times, receiving important feedback for further implementation goals. We have made changes to our Epics and implementation goals within the Sprint Journal and our issue tracker.
