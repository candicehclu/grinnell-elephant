Write the estimates using some unit of time or effort (e.g. hours or beans). If the unit is not a common measure of time, include a description of what the unit means.

### Goals: Name the outcomes you plan to complete this sprint. Consider your backlog and the parameters of this week's milestone.

### Task breakdown: For the work you plan to do this sprint, summarize the component parts. (Ok to just refer to your issue tracker.)
