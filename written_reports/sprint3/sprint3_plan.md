# Sprint 3 Planning Report

### Capacity:
- This sprint 3, our team aims to do more work on coding contribution as mentioned in our review of the previous sprint. Before the contribution we're not equally divided up and fell more on our lead developer and team members with consistent access to XCode. As for this sprint, we have discussed each team member's availability and each person will contribute approximately 9 hours per week.

### Goals:
- This sprint we plant to keep working on the coding implementation for Elephant, using our issue tracker backlog and assignments to assign our epic goals before moving on to the next epic. Our current goals for implementation include building on the framework of the Homepage (of the app), Timer page, pomodoro page, mystery token page, collectible pack homepage, settings, and user manual with more aesthetic and user-friendly features and layout.

### Task breakdown:
Our current tasks breakdown is currently as follows:
- Hyeyun: Manual Page
- Gabby: Settings page
- Mae: Homepage
- Candice: Shop

Once we reach a good place in developing these main feature pages, we refer to our issue tracker where we have assigned tasks to each team member. Once some of our team developers make changes to the app functionality and feel ready to move on, we will begin implementation of the widget featuers and layout.

### Assignment: What will each team member do this sprint?
In this sprint, our main focus is the development portion of the project as the initial project build-up assignments took most of our time. We are all planning to work on the overall implementation and have divided up the tasks in our backlog, assigning pages to each team member. We currently work with these roles but **this table does not mean each person is entitled to their role nor that they should be the only one doing the task.** We should all collaborate to work on every task but this table shows who should lead each task since there are lots of tasks and assignments can be confusing.

| Role                         | Responsibilities |
|------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Project Manager (Hyeyun)**    | Oversees sprint progress and reports, manages deadlines/Trello board, organizes meetings, and ensures team coordination. |
| **Lead Developer (Candice)** | Oversees overall implementation, handles technical setup, coding standards, and supports development in Swift and Xcode. |
| **Lead Designer (Mae)** | Responsible for design-related tasks (e.g., character design, coloring, paper prototyping) and brainstorming app ideas. |
| **Documentation & Reporting Lead (Gabby)** | Reviews and updates sprint reports, maintains documentation, and ensures clear communication of progress (grammar, wording..etc..).  |

### Issue Tracker: How can your instructor view the results of your sprint planning using your issue tracker?
