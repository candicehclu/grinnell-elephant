# Sprint 3 Planning Report

### Capacity: How much work can your team do this sprint? (More, less, or the same as last sprint.) Consider each team member's availability and how accurate your time estimates were for last week's tasks.
Write the estimates using some unit of time or effort (e.g. hours or beans). If the unit is not a common measure of time, include a description of what the unit means.

### Goals: Name the outcomes you plan to complete this sprint. Consider your backlog and the parameters of this week's milestone.
- This sprint we plant to keep working on the coding implementation for Elephant, using our issue tracker backlog and assignments to assign our epic goals before moving on to the next epic. Our current goals for implementation include building on the framework of the Homepage (of the app), Timer page, pomodoro page, mystery token page, collectible pack homepage, settings, and user manual with more aesthetic and user-friendly features and layout.

### Task breakdown: For the work you plan to do this sprint, summarize the component parts. (Ok to just refer to your issue tracker.)
