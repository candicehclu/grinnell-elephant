# Sprint 5 Journal

## Adoption Plan
#### Date: 
#### Is your product ready for adoption?

#### Current State of product development
Describe the current state of your product's development at the time of writing this journal entry.

So far, Elephant is in a prototype stage, with only the user interface (UI) components are completed. Users can interact with the homepage functionalities such as manual, changing themes in settings. Moreover, users can add a widget to the widget bar. However, there is no functional pomodoro or stopwatch working at this point. Moreover, users can experience adding checklist, but there is no backend data structure to store it. The main app UI exists, but core features like timer settings, purchasing avatars are not availalble. No backend or data storage beyong this UI mockup is currently available.


#### Risk/Benefit Analysis
Give a comprehensive risk/benefit analysis of your product by stating at least 5 risks or benefits of using your product

##### Benefits
For current version, the benefits are:
1. The app has a visually appealing and intuitive interface, which helps users to navigate the app easily.
2. For weidget, users can see how the widget will look like and where it will show in their laptop
3. We can get feedbacks from stakeholders through current UI-focused prototype and fix it before backend. (Our backend is straightforward since we store data locally)
4. For the current state, by using this product, we can finalize the UI structure early to reducing the possible waste of time that does not go well with front-end
5. Having a working UI in current states allow developers to get direct experience what users are facing.

If the app is fully developed, then:
1. (If the app is fully developed) Users can acheive wellness and work balance.
2. Users can motivate themselves by checking off the task and earn tokens
3. Fratures like customizable themes, timers, and avatars make the app fun and personal, increasing the engagement.
4. Widget-based interactions will allow distraction-free experience.
5. Shared team boards can support social motivation and group productivity.


##### Risk
(If fully developed)
1. Becoming too  reliant on the app.
2. Abuse use of tokens
3. Possible privacy & data concerns since this is integrated to Apple (since appple app).
4. There can be stress & guilt for users if they could not do tasks --> could dismotivate users.
5. The notifications can be distracting and bother the focus.

##### Is it right to encourage people to adopt your product in its current state? Or will you continue developing instead? Explain your decision.
No, it is not right to encourage people to adopt our prduct in its current state because we do not have working functionalities. For example, we do not have stopwatch, pomodoro, widget integrations except for basic UIs. So, it is not appropriate. Therefore, we will continue developing instead to have working pomodoro and stopwatch function with widget.

#### Adoption plan (if ready for adoption)

We have received support from Reslife so our initial product will be targeted towards incoming freshman students who will be juggling both college academics and social scenes. For example, we will have preset wellness checklist that includes fun wellness tasks students can do to take a break while exploring Grinnell, such as getting ice cream at Dari Barn, get snacks from DSA, or chill on the hammocks and watch sunset. We have also received funding from the Catalyst so once the product is completed and tested, we will host it on Firebase and release it on Apple Store, allowing students to download it for free. For promotion, we will introduce it to incoming students during New Student Orientation, and we also plan to table in the coming semester to promote it to other students. It is also possible that we work with Reslife to further incentivize students to use the product, such as gift card draws or offering free Dari Barn coupons.

We hope that the app will serve as a reminder to students that academics and socialization are equally important. Even when work gets overwhelming, taking time off for oneself and sharing some time with friends is not a waste of time, but necessary to ensure wellness and productivity. Not only does the app serve as a productivity management tool, it also reminds students of all the fun things they can do at Grinnell. While most promotion will focus on freshman students, we believe that all students can benefit from using the app while they are working. We hope that students will have the widget on their sidebar when working on assignments, and depending on their working style, use either the pomodoro timer or the stopwatch to record how much time has passed, and set up notifications to remind them to take breaks.

In long term, if we receive good feedback from the campus community, we plan on promoting it to users outside of Grinnell. There are two potential ways to achieve this. Firstly, we can promote to residential life departments in other institutions, particularly other liberal arts colleges known for rigorous academics. Another option is to promote it to general users that work long hours in front of their computers, including students, researchers, office workers, etc. To promote it to these users, we can share it with our family and friends, or pay influencers to try it out and recommend it to others. The app will be accessible as we will release it on Apple Store and it will be free for everyone.

#### Continued development plan (if not ready for adoption)
Will your product be ready for adoption after some future work? Why or why not? (Don't be too hard on yourself if you decide not. Many software products make their most important impact as a learning experience for the development team rather than by reaching target users. It's totally fine if that's the case for your product. We are responsible to only encourage others to use our software when it is right to do so.)
If you answered yes to the previous question, what future work is needed before adoption? Aim high. You will not be evaluated on completing all the future work.
If you answered no, what future work is needed for you to tie off the loose ends of your product and feel satisfied in your learning?
