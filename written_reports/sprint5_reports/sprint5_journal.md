#### Is your product ready for adoption?
Describe the current state of your product's development at the time of writing this journal entry.
Give a comprehensive risk/benefit analysis of your product by stating at least 5 risks or benefits of using your product
Is it right to encourage people to adopt your product in its current state? Or will you continue developing instead? Explain your decision.

#### Adoption plan (if ready for adoption)
Describe your goals for the successful adoption of your product. Aim high. You will not be evaluated on meeting your adoption goals. Think about who you want to use your product, the depth of their usage, in what context, and for how long.
How will you make potential users aware of your product and convince them to try it?
How will you make it easy for potential users obtain to access to your product?

#### Continued development plan (if not ready for adoption)
Will your product be ready for adoption after some future work? Why or why not? (Don't be too hard on yourself if you decide not. Many software products make their most important impact as a learning experience for the development team rather than by reaching target users. It's totally fine if that's the case for your product. We are responsible to only encourage others to use our software when it is right to do so.)
If you answered yes to the previous question, what future work is needed before adoption? Aim high. You will not be evaluated on completing all the future work.
If you answered no, what future work is needed for you to tie off the loose ends of your product and feel satisfied in your learning?
