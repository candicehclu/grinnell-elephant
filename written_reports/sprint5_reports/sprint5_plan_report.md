## Sprint 5 Planning Report

#### Capacity: 
Write the estimates using some unit of time or effort (e.g. hours or beans). If the unit is not a common measure of time, include a description of what the unit means.
- For sprint 5, our team is aiming to complete a MVP for Elephant: A Wellness Trunk, meaning that within the scope of time we have to complete the project, we plan to keep implementing final changes to the app UI and continue developing the widget to be in sync with the app functionality.
- Furthermore, we will meet with our stakeholders to update them and get feedback on the progress of our app, including widget operations as well. We're hoping to work around 10 hours a week like in our last sprint with more involvement this first week of the sprint in preparation for final presentations next week.

#### Goals:
For our final sprint, we plan to keep working on the coding implementation for Elephant, using our issue tracker backlog and assignments to assign our epic goals before moving on to the next epic. 
Our goals for code development include making design touch-ups on pages that need it, sorting out existing bugs, working on storing settings information, and developing the stopwatch and pomodoro timers to be integrated into the widget.

**Task breakdown:**
Our current task breakdown is as follows:

Shared Tasks: 
*task 1.* Learn how to store data with Firebase and PostgreSQL
*task 2.* Set up implement data storage pipeline

Hyeyun: task 1. task 2.
Gabby: Settings mode, text resizing and integrating custom list to widget
Mae: Connect the timers from the homepage to the widget
Candice: task 1. task 2.

Once we reach a good place in development and feedback, we will refer to our issue tracker, where we have assigned tasks to each team member on our backlog and current sprint. 
Our immediate next goal is to connect app features to the widget interface and present that in our upcoming demonstration.

#### Assignment: 
In sprint 5, all of our team members will be prioritizing their developing pages in the backlog tasks in our issue tracker. Our main focus is the development of the widget and fixing existing functions to be transferrable from the app's functions. 
We are all planning to work on the different implementations and have divided up the tasks in our backlog, assigning various tasks for each team member. We currently work with these roles but **this table does not mean each person is entitled to their role nor that they should be the only one doing the task.** 
We should all collaborate to work on every task but this table shows who should lead each task since there are lots of tasks and assignments can be confusing.

| Role                         | Responsibilities |
|------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Project Manager (Hyeyun)**    | Oversees sprint progress and reports, manages deadlines/Trello board, organizes meetings, and ensures team coordination. |
| **Lead Developer (Candice)** | Oversees overall implementation, handles technical setup, coding standards, and supports development in Swift and Xcode. |
| **Lead Designer (Mae)** | Responsible for design-related tasks (e.g., character design, coloring, paper prototyping) and brainstorming app ideas. |
| **Documentation & Reporting Lead (Gabby)** | Reviews and updates sprint reports, maintains documentation, and ensures clear communication of progress (grammar, wording..etc..).  |

### Issue Tracker: How can your instructor view the results of your sprint planning using your issue tracker?
