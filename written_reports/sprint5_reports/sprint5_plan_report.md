# Sprint 5 Planning Report

### Capacity:
- For sprint 5, our team is aiming to reach the minimal viable product stage (MVP). This should take each team member 15-20 hours for their respective tasks, write-ups, presentation, and collaboration.
### Goals:
- This sprint, we plan to get to the MVP where users should be able to navigate to different pages, create and use at least one checklist, earn tokens, and replace widget avatars.
### Task breakdown:
Our current task breakdown is as follows:
- Hyeyun: Adoption Plan (Q2), Notification Bone Structure, Token System
- Gabby: Adoption Plan (Q3a, Q3b), Completing Settings, Checklist page, Settings Connection
- Candice: Adoption Plan (Q3a, Q3b), Pomodoro Logic, Connecting Timers to Widget
- Mae: Blog Post, Adjust Homepage, Checklist page, Settings Connection
- Other tasks: cleaning up UI and code, other wrap-up, Data (Firebase, SQL)

Once we are closer to our MVP, we will refer to our issue tracker, where we have assigned tasks to each team member. Once the MVP is ready, we will continue collaboration and possibly work to enhance the product. 

### Assignment: What will each team member do this sprint?
In this sprint, our main focus is the development of the MVP.
