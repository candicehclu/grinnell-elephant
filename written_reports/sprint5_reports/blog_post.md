## Overview:
_Elephant: A Wellness Trunk_ is created to promote better habits and help students find a balance between productivity and wellness. Our main audience is first year students as they are entering a new stage of life which can be busy and confusing. However, this app is made for anyone to use, any college student and professors amongst others. The gamification of the app is what brings these groups together. Through multiple stages, processes, and support of faculty and the Wilson Center, _Elephant: A Wellness Trunk_ was developed!

## Motivation:
At Grinnell, the cycle of procrastinating, cramming, and crashing has become the norm — a grind culture Grinnellians know a little too well. You might find yourself in HSSC or Burling late at night, hunched over your laptop for hours on end trying to get meet a deadline. You might also see others in a similar boat. While this lifestyle (dehydrated, tired, stagnant, etc.) might seem like just another part of college, it damages out mental and physical well-being. 

## Product:
_Elephant: A Wellness Trunk_ has one purpose: to integrate wellness into your busy work routine—seamlessly and thoughtfully.

Elephant provides college students amongst other users with tools to keep them on task and productive on their own terms. Using tools like Pomodoro, stopwatch timers, and collectible avatars, users can create personalized structure and have incentives to learn balance and to take care of themselves.

Using clearly defined labels or common symbols, Elephant is organized to be intuitive and user friendly.

First time users or users with any questions, can click the "?" button that will navigate to the manual page as seen in the image. This button can be found on most pages to provide users with immediate access to general information

In order to adjust the theme, switch between light/dark mode, or adjust any timer durations, users can simply navigate to the settings page "⛭" (settings button can also be found on any page) and adjust as wanted.

Users can decide on the mode on the hompage itself which provides straight forward navigation and change to mode.

To access the timer page presented above, user would select the button itself whereas to change the mode they would select where it says the current selection on the homepage. Based on user choice, the timer page will update. Once the user starts a timer, they cannot navigate out of the page which encourages avoiding distractions and taking breaks.

The shop page allows users to spend the tokens they earned by completing tasks (wellness or productivity). The gamification of task completion calls to users that like collecting and encourages users to take care of themselves or stay productive to continue earning tokens and avatars.

The avatar page allows users to customize their timer page.

Users are able to customize their checklists to their schedule and habits they might want to set. There will be a default option to provide a starting point. 

## Process:
The development of _Elephant: A Wellness Trunk_ can be broken down to 3 main stages:
  1. <ins>Requirements</ins>: During this stage, we created a general list of features, access, and possible users. We broke these down and categorized these by what our team wanted in the minimal viable product (MVP) and what features we could add after the MVP.
  2. <ins>Design</ins>: We began the design stage by creating a simple paper prototype to roughly model the app and used it to test it with stakeholders (2 students and a professor). The paper prototype was an interactive process where we tested, got feedback, adjusted, then repeat. In this same process, we planner our software model and architecture.     
  3. <ins>Implementation</ins>: With ample feedback and models to guide us, in this stage we focused on building a bare bones structure of the app, then adding the UI, followed by functionality. During implementation, we realized some aspects of our MVP was not possible due to the nature of widgets (cannot update every second). Thus, we made some adjustments, and decided to leave the timer and collection on the app itself.
  4. <ins>Lessons Learned</ins>: Our groups only had a few hiccups in our collaboration. The few times we did, we found that it led back to communication. We addressed issues immediately and updated our Team Norms as well. Our group also developed our skills in programming using Xcode and SwiftUI, since this was the first time delving this deep into the language.

## Acknowledgments
