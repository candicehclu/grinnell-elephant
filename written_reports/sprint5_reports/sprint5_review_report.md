# Sprint 5 Review

In this sprint, we focused on reaching the minimal viable product (MVP) with a few tweaks based on team discussions, stakeholder feedback, and newfound limitations.

### How has your product improved or progressed from a customer perspective? Describe high-level features that a non-technical user could recognize and appreciate.
We finetuned the front-end (UI) by making buttons consistent, themes match across different pages, and moving buttons around. However, we are limiting the use of widgets for now since widgets cannot count up/down every second. Due to this issue, we moved the timers to the app itself. The homepage now has a dropdown menu when you click on the mode selected to switch between modes. If the user clicks on the mode button itself, they'll be directed to the respective timer page. We also moved the main checklist page to the homepage for easy access. The users are also able to purchase and change their avatars.

### What progress have you made that is not visible to a common user?
We moved the code for the buttons to Utils to call it from there to maintain consistency across pages. Furthermore, we also finalized the token reward system and connected it to the checklist. Users may or may not notice this, as it was somewhat working previously, but not to the full extent.
