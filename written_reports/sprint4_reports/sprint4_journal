ContentView, entire file

Teammate A (Medhashree) needs to adjust the header to include the main author(s) of the file, a description of the file, dependencies, and resources used when developing. Furthermore, the documentation in the code should include a small description of the scope of the code within "{...}

Teammate A made sure to include a description at the end of larger blocks of code within "{...}" that showed the responsibilities of the buttons. The inclusion of "TODO" comments were helpful as it is easy to find and has a note of what needs to be done.
