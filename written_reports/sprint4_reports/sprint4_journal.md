## Documentation Lab

**Note: Since we are small group (4 people only), we collaborated on code before. Therefore, our subgroups already shared knowledge on what we were working on and we used the same langauge. However, there was still room for imporvement in terms of documentation**


### Subgroup 1: Medhashree & Hyeyun

1. Teammate A: Medhashree, Teammate B: Hyeyun

ContentView, entire file

Teammate A (Medhashree) needs to adjust the header to include the main author(s) of the file, a description of the file, dependencies, and resources used when developing. Furthermore, the documentation in the code should include a small description of the scope of the code within "{...}

Teammate A made sure to include a description at the end of larger blocks of code within "{...}" that showed the responsibilities of the buttons. The inclusion of "TODO" comments were helpful as it is easy to find and has a note of what needs to be done.

2. Teammate A: Hyeyun, Teammate B: Medhashree

ManualView.swift, entire file

Teammat A (Mae) suggested: Adding description of the file, more documnation on the purpose of the function, documentation on what is happening (a line is sufficent) before each code block for each UI,
                          Add Todo for aesthetics part so that others can see what I have to work on/ and it is easily navigatble for others.
                          Spacing consistnet -- devleoper guideline on formaning (needed to be added).
                          You can put other referneces in each function on top and write where each used.

Helpful: Resources/References on the top & before each function (wehre we used it), comment after each "}" helpful to navigate the scope, but it would be more helpful to add what vstack belongs to (is it for button or not?) since
we have multiple vstacks.
