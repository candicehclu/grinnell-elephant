##  External Documentation and Stakeholder Meetings

### Meeting 1
#### Who you met with
##### Name, occupation, and other relevant information about the stakeholder
- Hannah Kim, student biology major & statistics concentration. Not a long time mac user.
- Reviewed paper prototype
##### Date and time of the stakeholder meeting
- 04/22/2025 02:30pm - 3:00pm
##### Description of the test session and feedback
##### What was their behavior of interacting with the documentation?
1. Navigation to the app: When she opened the app, I told her to navigate to the manual/help page.
2. Navigation to the settings page: In the home screen, told her to navigate to the settings page
3. Changing themes in settings page: Prompted to change the themes
4. Purchasing Avatar in the collectible shop: Asked to navigate to collectible shop and try purchasing the avatar.
5. Read through the manual: Asked her to read all pages the manual till the end using the buttons
6. Adding to Widget: Asked her to add the elephant app to the widget bar just by manual explanation.
##### Did they succeed or get stuck?
- She succeeded in all 1-5, but since it was not clear what the widget bar is and there were no photos on how to add (and she is new to mac), so she could not success the task 6. 
##### What feedback did they provide about documentation?
- She said a picture or video of how to add widget to the widget bar would be helpful. The tester did not know what even widget bar is.
##### What questions did you ask, and what were the stakeholder's answers?
- I asked the if there is any buttons or other parts confusing
  - She said except for widget description everything was straightforward.
  - Additionally, she told us the time changing scroll in the settings page is not intuitivie. It does not show what time she is currently setting to if she scrolls.
- Is design suitable for readability and accesibility?
  - She said themes needed to be changed because only the background color changes and the font colors dont change. This makes letters hard to read
- Any other feedback
  - The homebutton crashes in the settings page.
  - The back button crashes in collectible shop for MacApp scheme.   

#### How we will change
- Fix homebutton for each page
- Themes should be changed (fonts should be readable colors wheren light/dark mode)
- Check every buttons for working
- Fix manual to be more intuitive
- Add description of what the widget bar is
- Add the entry showing what current time is set to.
  
### Meeting 2
#### Who you met with
##### Name, occupation, and other relevant information about the stakeholder
- Professor Wells, a Statistics Professor at Grinnell
##### Date and time of the stakeholder meeting
- 04/24/2025 1:00pm -1:30pm
##### Description of the test session and feedback
##### What was their behavior of interacting with the documentation?
1. Find and read the manual or help section
  - In the last page of the manual, try adding widget based on the instruction
2. Try to access and browse the collectible shop
3. Try purchasing one item (just  UI part)
4. Navigate to settings and try changing one setting (is UI intuititive)
5. Try adding task using add task list.

##### Did they succeed or get stuck?
1. He was a bit confused in navigating to the manual, but eventually found it once clicking on the question mark in the top-right corner
    - Text alignment also came into question but it was more of a nitpicky suggestions (as quoted)
    - Non-clickable check boxes within the manual page view (either make them as a screenshot image or make them clickable)
    - Wants more description for the difference between Pomodoro and Stopwatch (hovering over it to get more information)
1. Professor Wells tried to navigate to add the widget to the desktop but since he's not as familiar with macs, it took a bit more time to open the widget.
   He attempted to add the widget using the manual instructions but had to navigate back to the app to add it to the laptop widget bar.

2. & 3. Was able to navigate the collectible shop and successfully accessed
4. Mode changes for light mode are not working and make it unable to read. You can do any themes in dark mode, however. So he asked for changes to the text within light mode to be able to see within any theme setting
5. Had trouble finding out how to add a new task; the + symbol to add a new task within the custom checklist was confusing.
   The only way to add the task is with a return and you can only get out of the checklist with esc button on the keyboard.
   The scale for the time durations should begin at 0. He did like how the time sliders we're able to show what position the user selected easily.
##### What feedback did they provide about documentation?
- In the help section, he felt that he wasn't sure what was there for him to read or actually thoroughly go through.
- Consistency with going back to home page, there wasn't really a way to go back from the checklist page.
- Back and next button for every page view or set the Manual page view to be a scroll view instead (consistency with either scroll view/next page action)
- It might be too much information for the first user, there's a lot of context that a first time user wouldn't really understand in reading up to 4 pages
- He likes the first manual page, and suggested that we change the manual to be a step-by-step introduction for the app (e.g. get the user to make the first task to get familiar with the app) and possibly add sections to the manual to understand what each page's information includes for the user's questions.
##### What questions did you ask, and what were the stakeholder's answers?

***Before***

- What is the first impression when you saw the app? (Confusing? less intuitive)?
  - Professor Wells stated that he likes the initial view of the app, and then asked what the elephant does, haha

***After & During***
- We asked for more feedback on the UI and what was confusing upon first interaction, but he had already answered previously for our documentation feedback questions.

- Was anything unclear or confusing when using the app?
  -  Nothing else from what was already mentioned

- Is anything missing that you expected? (like what do you expect widget to do?)
  - He wants the elephant to be more interactive (possibly move around or something when presssed on)
  - Also within shop page view, he'd like to see how many total tokens you have
  -  And be able to hover over each item and label the tokens that the avatar costs


#### How we might change
- For the manual instead of long readings, we will create buttons that go to the specific page so that user has more control
- Make checklist clickable in manual
- Change elephant to moving.
- Make checklist addable with the + button
- Make it checkable & save, cancel
- Add how many tokens do I have left in the collectible shop
- Unify back & homebutton for each page
- Theme fixes


### Meeting 3

#### Who you met with
##### Name, occupation, and other relevant information about the stakeholder
- Autumn Kwon, CS major at Grinnell
##### Date and time of the stakeholder meeting
- 04/24/2025 7:20pm - 7:50pm
##### Description of the test session and feedback
##### What was their behavior of interacting with the documentation?
1. Find and read the manual or help section
  - In the last page of the manual, try adding widget based on the instruction
2. Try to access and browse the collectible shop
3. Try purchasing one item (just  UI part)
4. Navigate to settings and try changing one setting (is UI intuititive)
5. Try adding task using add task list.
6. Try to check off one of the task

##### Did they succeed or get stuck?
1. Getting to manual Sucess
  - She was confused with does date and time mean in the app or not.
  - She managed to get to add 
2. Success
3. Successfully
4. Succesfully changed the setting
5. Success

##### What feedback did they provide about documentation?
- The alignment of text of manual is not pleasing
- The checklist looks like it is clickable
- Why black and white defulat? (default is not set to the default color)
- Why is there no elephant theme
- If change theme, the frame looks funky
- Why is there checklist #1? What does each number mean.
- What if I want to create another checklist? Why is it still #1?
- Why is there empty spot after custom list? (WHat is the intention?)
- The checklist does not fit well with the meaning of the settings.
- The color combination of the widget is not appealing. Why orange not pastel?

##### What questions did you ask, and what were the stakeholder's answers?

***Before***

- What is the first impression when you saw the app? (Confusing? less intuitive)?
  - She said the design is cute. Why the app name is Elephant?    

***After & During***
- Was anything unclear or confusing when using the app?
  - WHy the checklist is in the settings?
  - Does not get how the checklist operates
  - How does avatar work?
    
- Is anything missing that you expected? (like what do you expect widget to do?)
  - She wanted to try buying the avatar. She wanted some free tokens to try out purchasing.
  - Why are charactesr all 5 tokens?


#### How we might change
- Change the locaiton of the checklist
- Add description of how avatar works
- More direction on the colectible shop.
- More intuitive explanation & with pictures for first time mac users.
  
## Documentation Lab

**Note: Since we are small group (4 people only), we collaborated on code before. Therefore, our subgroups already shared knowledge on what we were working on and we used the same langauge. However, there was still room for imporvement in terms of documentation**


### Subgroup 1: Medhashree & Hyeyun

1. Teammate A: Medhashree, Teammate B: Hyeyun

- Identify the code that you worked with in the lab (e.g., calico.java, lines 1-437)
  - ContentView, entire file

- Write a paragraph to describe the changes that you made to the code and the documentation
  - **Feedback**
  - Teammate A (Medhashree) needs to adjust the header to include the main author(s) of the file, a description of the file, dependencies, and resources used when developing. Furthermore, the documentation in the code should include a small description of the scope of the code within "{...}
  - **Changes**
  - In the ContentView header, I added the main authors, description, dependencies, and resources as suggested.
  - I also added more comments throughout the file.

- Identify existing documentation that was helpful
  - Teammate A made sure to include a description at the end of larger blocks of code within "{...}" that showed the responsibilities of the buttons. The inclusion of "TODO" comments was helpful as it is easy to find and has a note of what needs to be done.

- Identify the commit hash of the commit in which you wrote your new documentation. Provide a Github link where your instructor can view the diff of that commit. If you created or updated any issues in your issue tracker, show a "before" and "after" snapshot of the detailed view of each issue so that the difference can clearly be seen
  - Before: eb8977286d98e1303a18065a0ef8071115949af2 (tag initial-release)
  - After: 06d6b95


2. Teammate A: Hyeyun, Teammate B: Medhashree

- Identify the code that you worked with in the lab (e.g. calico.java, lines 1-437)
  - ManualView.swift, entire file 
- Write a paragraph to describe the changes that you made to the code and the documentation
  - **Feedback**
  - Teammate A (Mae) suggested: Adding description of the file, more documentation on the purpose of the function, documentation on what is happening (a line is sufficient) before each code block for each UI. Add a TODO for the aesthetics part so that others can see what I have to work on/ and it is easily navigable for others—spacing consistent -- developer guideline on formatting (needed to be added). You can put other references in each function on top and write where they each used.
  - **Changes**
  - I added the file description on top of the file.
  - I added purpose of the template struct on top of ManualTemplateView struct
  - I added the Todo for the parts that needed to be completed later
  - I added box for each section in the stack what each stack accounts for in the template struct
  - I formated using the Xcode>structure>'swift-file format'
  - I put references altogether on top
- Identify existing documentation that was helpful
  - Helpful: Resources/References on the top & before each function (wehre we used it), comment after each "}" helpful to navigate the scope, but it would be more helpful to add what  vstack belongs to (is it for button or not?) since
we have multiple vstacks.
- Identify the commit hash of the commit in which you wrote your new documentation. Provide a Github link where your instructor can view the diff of that commit. If you created or updated any issues in your issue tracker, show a "before" and "after" snapshot of the detailed view of each issue so that the difference can clearly be seen
  - Before: eb8977286d98e1303a18065a0ef8071115949af2 (tag initial-release)
  - After:  ebaf7948204541fd617dcf8a51d1246454408102

### Subgroup 2: Candice & Gabby

1. Teammate A: Gabby, Teammate B: Candice

2. Reviewed SetingsView.swift file, 
- code snippet: ~lines 10-114~ within ~SettingsView~

**Feedback**
- For sections where Gabby didn't give very descriptive or detailed documentation, she added more helpful comments that explained thoroughly how each part of the SettingsView was implemented. She included more description about where certain functions defined in the lower lines of the snippet (88-112) are coming from and how this compacting of functions at the end of SettingsView allowed for greater readability within the main SettingsView view.

**What Changes were made**
- Describe what changes you made

**Helpful:**
Helpful: There were larger comments before long snippets of code that explained the functionality of the following lines, but for some lines where there wasn't enough description for a longer code line, we made changes to this by making sure those lines were descriptive enough.

**Before:**  eb8977286d98e1303a18065a0ef8071115949af2 (tag initial-release)
**After:** `1e11d5c0235baf456dd14444ae1e73f2d1bbaf83`

3. Teammate A: Candice, Teammate B: Gabby

4. Review Utils.swift file, entire file

**Feedback:** Candice worked on re-usable functions and stucts, including Default Colors for theme changes as well as a default ElephantButton that can be used across various files. We discussed adding more documentation to the file for more descriptive explanations of each function and which files it mostly interacts with, like SettingsView.

**Helpful:** There are initial comment descriptions for each utility, describing what that utility performs as well as helpful function definitions describing what use that function/struct performs.

***Changes:*** I added more documentation in the beginning of the file, specifically what the reusable components are, as well as some in-line documentation of how the reusable components can be further changed to allow more customization.

Before: eb8977286d98e1303a18065a0ef8071115949af2 (tag initial-release)
After: dfc1da55877419861e1e670bee239d652c0724b6


## Generative AI Experiment 
***Answer Following Questions***
1. In CSC 324, which uses of AI have the potential to advance product development and how?
2. In CSC 324, which uses of AI have the potential to support student learning and how?
3. In CSC 324, which uses of AI have the potential to undermine student learning and how?

### Hyeyun
Hyeyun's Prompt: **I am doing a project for the Wellness app called Elephant. I am in charge of Manual Page. I am using swift. I have a template struct for each page. Can you create a documentation (like purpose, pre,post conditions) for this struct so that others can understand? Also, suggest internal documentations too:** I attached the code block of ***struct ManualTemplateView***.

I used chatgpt 

AI gave me both top-level documentation (3p) and suggested inline comments. The top level documentation looks like:

```
/// `ManualTemplateView` is a reusable SwiftUI view component used to create consistent layout pages
/// in the Elephant wellness app's Manual section. It supports navigation between sequential manual pages,
/// and optionally provides a return to the home page.
///
/// - Purpose:
///   - To provide a consistent layout wrapper for individual manual pages with navigation and styling support.
///
/// - Pre-conditions:
///   - `content` must be a valid SwiftUI view.
///   - `currentPageIdentifier` must be a unique string identifier used for accessibility.
///
/// - Post-conditions:
///   - The rendered view will include:
///     - A home button (if `homePage` is provided)
///     - A scrollable content view area with the supplied `content`
///     - Optional navigation buttons to `backPage` and `nextPage`
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - `currentPageIdentifier`: A unique string used for accessibility and view identification.
///   - `content`: A closure that returns the SwiftUI View representing the main content of the page.
///   - `backPage`: An optional view to navigate to the previous page.
///   - `nextPage`: An optional view to navigate to the next page.
///   - `homePage`: An optional view to return to the home screen.
```

The inline suggesntions were: 
1. Adding Example usage:

```
/// ## Example Usage:
/// ```swift
/// ManualTemplateView(currentPageIdentifier: "welcomePage") {
///     Text("Welcome to the Elephant App!")
/// } backPage: {
///     AnyView(IntroPageView())
/// } nextPage: {
///     AnyView(SetupPageView())
/// } homePage: {
///     AnyView(HomeScreenView())
/// }
/// ```
```
2. Make consistent and aligned

#### Questions
1. In CSC 324, which uses of AI have the potential to advance product development and how?
   - The documentation generation would save some time if the intention of the app is clear.
   - Moreover, debugging the git issue could be also helpful for entry-level developers not used to github
   - If students have stress, they can use it for venting or suggest ways to how to talk about this issue with other peers.
2. In CSC 324, which uses of AI have the potential to support student learning and how?
   - Since there are so many resources out there, using AI that provides sources/references to the answers can support student learning by providing what sources they should look for.
   - Moreover, there can be languages that are unpopular, so if a student wants to learn, there may be limited resources. AI can help with the learning by helping students to learn unpopular langauge through LLM model.
3. In CSC 324, which uses of AI have the potential to undermine student learning and how?
   - The worrying part is that AI hallucinations. It is possible that student trust the unverified information and apply that to their understanding. This could harm the student's learning overall.
   - Moreover, generating the entire code is not helpful since the student won't learn anything.
4. What are some ethical considerations of using AI in CSC 324?
   - Since most of students are developing an app, user cases are important. It is possible that there can be bias in the model due to their training data. We should be careful with the answers we get and make sure our app is not biased.
   - In terms of fairness, it would be unfair for a groupmate to use AI for their entire work while others try hard and learn. That would undermine others' work.

### Mae
I experimented with ChatGPT as the AI Experiment. I was having trouble formatting and aligning the features on the widget, so I input about 10 lines of code into ChatGPT, prompting it to help solve this issue. ChatGPT, in turn, made slight tweaks to the stack order.

```
HStack{
    VStack (alignment: .leading) {
        Text("Checklist")
            .font(.title)
            .foregroundStyle(.black)

        Text("[] task 1, \n[] task 2, \n[] task 3")
            .frame(alignment: .leading)
            .multilineTextAlignment(.leading)
    } // checklist title and list
    .padding(.leading, 20)
    .padding(.vertical, 12)
    .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, alignment: .leading)
```

1. In CSC 324, which uses of AI have the potential to advance product development and how?
   - If well informed, AI could be used as an aid in revising the sprint report or journal. This would have to include us providing the AI model with the report so it can suggest the changes.
   - Given a function with a simple documentation, but sufficient examples, it could assist in figuring out the intent of the function.
2. In CSC 324, which uses of AI have the potential to support student learning and how?
   - After utilizing documentation and tutorials, it can then be used as a last resort to further explain or even help find a starting point.
   - It can be helpful when working with UI for formatting issues. Using AI to help solve formatting issues with minimal code can save time and place focus on further development. This can help avoid getting hung up on a minor detail that is difficult to format and help you understand it for next time.
3. In CSC 324, which uses of AI have the potential to undermine student learning and how?
   - If a developer is prompting AI to write starter code for the program, it can hinder their knowledge of the basic building blocks of the language.
   - While AI answers can be somewhat correct, blindly trusting and an over-reliance on it can produce hidden bugs. In these cases, the developer wouldn't have built the knowledge or ability to debug the issue.
   - If there is a bug or the developer is having trouble starting the code, going straight to AI rather than following video or written tutorials or other forms of documentation, takes away from the thinking process. 
4. What are some ethical considerations of using AI in CSC 324?
   - Using AI at any point is harmful to the environment. In 324, developers should be aware of the environmental impacts of using AI extensively in the coding process.
   - As a developer, following and complying with the code of ethics is vital. Developers should have a sense of what information should not be input with prompts.

### Candice
I submitted a screenshot and asked ChatGPT what the error message meant when I encountered problems with the bundle identifier in Xcode. Xcode gave me the error message: The app identifier 'Grinnell.Elephant' cannot be registered to your development team because it is not available.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/381b1efa-dc86-48b1-99ed-05d029c15770)

ChatGPT explained that: "This usually means the bundle ID Grinnell.Elephant is already taken by someone else (or was already used in your Apple Developer account). You can fix this by changing the Bundle Identifier to something more unique." It also proceeeded to give me steps on how to change the bundle identifier. 
<img width="671" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-27 at 11 25 08 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96b1fa29-6c34-45c6-b921-67a3403ae856" />

However, the target column was grey and Xcode wasn't letting me edit the bundle identifier. I asked ChatGPT again and it gave me further instructions on how to fix it. I followed the next steps, directly edited the plist.info file, and was able to build the app again.

1. In CSC 324, which uses of AI have the potential to advance product development and how?
   - Use of AI is particularly helpful for collaboration, such as summarizing updates or creating documentations. This can potentially avoid us overlooking certain details that we may have updated (or serve as a double check).
   - The existence of AI as a last resort alleviates stress when encountering deadlines or tough situations, making it feel more okay to spend more time experimenting and debugging.
   - Use of AI is helpful for debugging and can help us save time, particularly when the bug is rather minor and has little value for learning
2. In CSC 324, which uses of AI have the potential to support student learning and how?
   - Use of AI saves time looking up online sources, as keyword searches may not be as effective and may require prior knowledge. For example, without knowing the term "persistent storage", it might take me more time to find out that swift uses @AppStorage and UserDefaults to store variables across interfaces. AI bridges that gap by taking in longer descriptions that might be less accurate and respond based on plausible guesses.
   - Asking right questions can also yield helpful information, for example, asking AI to compare the similarities and differences between UserDefaults and @AppStorage can be helpful in learning when to use which.
   - Asking AI for hints or pseudocode can help students think and move forward with development without completely get stuck because they do not have the knowledge to know where to begin with.
3. In CSC 324, which uses of AI have the potential to undermine student learning and how?
   - Giving AI a description and asking AI to generate source code, as this hinders students' opportunities to think through the task and goals and write the code themselves.
   - Asking AI to generate documentation without considering formats may hinder collaboration, for example, a team may agree on a specific format and requirements, but an AI might not be aware and will not be able to meet that expectation.
4. What are some ethical considerations of using AI in CSC 324?
   - Overreliance on AI might hinder learning.
   - There is always the possibility that the code AI creates has undesirable side effects and potentially inefficient, especially if the user is not double checking the AI's output.
   - AI output is also potentially biased.
   - Some additional controversies of AI lies in how AI are trained on online materials that are not necessarily approved by original owners, raising problems of consent and copyright infringements.

### Gabby

I utilized ClaudeAI to help me with a section for adding a new task locally within the custom checklist section of SettingsView.
Explanation of My Request: I requested help implementing the ability to add a new task to a custom checklist. Specifically, I needed a way for a user to input a task name, add that task to a local list of tasks, clear the input field afterward, and mark the changes that were made so they could be saved or updated later. A portion of this functionality meant I had to create a function addNewTask() as cited in the TaskListStorage.swift, but I also needed help adding a local version within SettingsView since I was having trouble displaying saved changes. I asked the AI to help me think more granularly about adding a new input task, considering settings formatting with user input in the UI. I also asked AI more information about DispatchQueue [DispatchQueue – Apple Developer Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch/dispatch-queue) from what I read because of the FIFO queue implementation of that localTasks array where users newly added Tasks are moved into a queue order for the custom checklist implementation within  SettingsView.swift

//function `addTask(title)` in TaskList Storage.swift that I based off of for addNewTask() in SettingsView.swift
```
  //updates a new task to the taskList
    func addTask(title: String){
        let newTask = TaskItem(title: title)
        taskList.tasks.append(newTask)
        saveTasks()
    }
```

```
private func addNewTask() {
   ** let trim = newTask.trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespace) //Removes all extra spaces from user input on commit**
    guard !trim.isEmpty else { return }
    let newItem = TaskItem(title: trim)
    localTasks.append(newItem)
    hasChanged = true
    **DispatchQueue.main.async { //orders newly added task in the main UI in FIFO order to be displayed after
        self.newTask = "" //clears the input line (task) with an empty string
    }**
}
```
The bolded lines of code we're suggested in the AI's response, specifically for how to clean up given user formatting such as extra spaces before and after valid string input as suggested by .trimmingCharacters method that removes all whitespace, and how to use DispatchQueue to call on the main thread and perform the following action (clearing for a new task input) only after changes have been saved by selecting the Save button at bottom of the checklist #1 view sheet.

addNewTask(): The first line of code initializes trim, removing any leading or trailing spaces from the user's input (newTask) and stores the cleaned-up text in a variable called trim. Then, if the trimmed text is empty (meaning the user didn't type anything), the function exits early without doing anything and doesn't allow the user to add an empty string task. 
If trim is not empty then the function adds a new task (TaskItem) with trim as the task item title, adding the newly added task to the localTasks array of Task items. I also defined a boolean called hasChanged to work as a flag - tracking when the checklist has been modified, to allow a save or update later. The last few lines we're completely AI generated since DispatchQueue was an operator I was not familiar with - it clears the newTask input field to get it ready for the next task the user might want to enter.

#### 1. In CSC 324, which uses of AI have the potential to advance product development and how?
* I have been working with the app’s settings and many advancements in my development came from working with my initial implementation of a checklist for example, and then asking AI for assistance for specific features that I had seen in Swift UI documentation but with very little examples of how to implement. I think that AI should not be the backbone of our product development because it reproduces imperfections and also ones that are hard to catch once implementation is in more advanced stages.

#### 2. In CSC 324, which uses of AI have the potential to support student learning and how?
* For our class, I think that the learning curve to learn programming languages to work on our product as well as technological access have a great impact on our productivity. AI has the potential to support students specifically in moments where overview of certain functions or unknown definitions are needed, acting as a mini-mentor in that way by helping students supplement learning they may be missing due to the fast-paced environment. 

#### 3. In CSC 324, which uses of AI have the potential to undermine student learning and how?
* I think that the obvious pitfall is over-relying on it as mentioned in the first question because once you reach more advanced stages of development, it’s hard to distinguish between what code the AI wrote and determine what it even does if you’re not also learning at the same time.

#### 4. What are some ethical considerations of using AI in CSC 324?
* I’d consider the mal-use of AI being when students don’t only receive coding help but also don’t take the time to understand or even type the code suggestion they’re given, making it easy to fall into the trap of being overly-trusting of the solutions it comes up with instead of our own dynamic solutions.
* I also think about where AI compiles it’s coding solutions from, raising issues of plagiarism or now citing their sources.

In a Sprint Journal entry, remind us what your MVP is (look back to Milestone 1, where you described what features would be included in your MVP)
Describe what work, if any, remains toward delivering your MVP

- What is our MVP
  - We imagine our MVP to be a macOS widget UI that's compatible with dark and light mode and has high contrast options, such as black and white mode for those with color blindness. We also want to be able to push notifications to remind users to take wellness breaks. These breaks and tasks should be customizable based on the user. Users are also meant to earn tokens that can be exchanged for avatars that they can use to customize the widget.
  
- Describe what work remains toward MVP
  - We still need to work on incrementing the user's token status, pushing notifications, and the timers' logic. Currently, we have multiple parts of the software in development that need to come together.
