## Documentation Lab

**Note: Since we are small group (4 people only), we collaborated on code before. Therefore, our subgroups already shared knowledge on what we were working on and we used the same langauge. However, there was still room for imporvement in terms of documentation**


### Subgroup 1: Medhashree & Hyeyun

1. Teammate A: Medhashree, Teammate B: Hyeyun

ContentView, entire file

Teammate A (Medhashree) needs to adjust the header to include the main author(s) of the file, a description of the file, dependencies, and resources used when developing. Furthermore, the documentation in the code should include a small description of the scope of the code within "{...}

Teammate A made sure to include a description at the end of larger blocks of code within "{...}" that showed the responsibilities of the buttons. The inclusion of "TODO" comments were helpful as it is easy to find and has a note of what needs to be done.

2. Teammate A: Hyeyun, Teammate B: Medhashree

ManualView.swift, entire file

Teammat A (Mae) suggested: Adding description of the file, more documnation on the purpose of the function, documentation on what is happening (a line is sufficent) before each code block for each UI,
                          Add Todo for aesthetics part so that others can see what I have to work on/ and it is easily navigatble for others.
                          Spacing consistnet -- devleoper guideline on formaning (needed to be added).
                          You can put other referneces in each function on top and write where each used.

Helpful: Resources/References on the top & before each function (wehre we used it), comment after each "}" helpful to navigate the scope, but it would be more helpful to add what vstack belongs to (is it for button or not?) since
we have multiple vstacks.

### Subgroup 2: Candice & Gabby

1. Teammate A: Gabby, Teammate B: Candice

2. Reviewed SetingsView.swift file, 
- code snippet: ~lines 10-114~ within ~SettingsView~
- For sections where Gabby didn't give very descriptive or detailed documentation, she added more helpful comments that explained thoroughly how each part of the SettingsView was implemented. She included more description about where certain functions defined in the lower lines of the snippet (88-112) are coming from and how this compacting of functions at the end of SettingsView allowed for greater readability within the main SettingsView view.

Helpful: There were larger comments before long snippets of code that explained the functionality of the following lines, but for some lines where there wasn't enough description for a longer code line, we made changes to this by making sure those lines were descriptive enough.

3. Teammate A: Candice, Teammate B: Gabby

4. Review Utils.swift file, entire file

- Candice worked on re-usable functions and stucts, including Default Colors for theme changes as well as a default ElephantButton that can be used across various files. We discussed adding more documentation to the file for more descriptive explanations of each function and which files it mostly interacts with, like SettingsView.

Helpful: There are initial comment descriptions for each utility, describing what that utility performs as well as helpful function definitions describing what use that function/struct performs.
