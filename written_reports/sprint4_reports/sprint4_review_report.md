# Sprint 4 Review

This sprint, we focused on adding widget features and getting feedback from stakeholders for better user experiences.

### How has your product improved or progressed from a customer perspective? Describe high-level features that a non-technical user could recognize and appreciate.

We have most of the front-end (UI) development done. So, users can start adding the widget function to their mac widget. Moreover, there are working theme changes, checklists addition funcionality, and manual to read. 
Therefore, the parts that the user experiences, like the theme/color of the app, the manual, widget, are now working. 

### What progress have you made that is not visible to a common user?

We added and refiend documentation to each file's codes so that teammates can understand what is going on. This is not visible to the user but can boost the development and collaboration. Moreover, we started learning the firebase and postgreSQL for data storage which is not visible to the common user.
