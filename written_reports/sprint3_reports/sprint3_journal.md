# Sprint 3 Journal

## A summary of non-user-facing progress for this milestone.
For this milestone, the main non-user-facing progress involved setting up structure for storing task checklist using JSON files. Most of our work focused on UI development and feature implmentation, which are very noticeable to users,so backend improvements were minimal. In the next sprint, we plan to incorporate more functionality of the app.

## Requirements Document
- In this sprint, we changed our requirements by adding user stories that were missing from Milestone 1, with a user story for a light user (guest) and a team user. For the team user, we made edits to Candice's persona to extend it as that team user.

## Manual testing in place of automated testing for part or all of your product if:
*(a) your product belongs to a category (such as gaming) where manual testing is a widely accepted industry standard OR*
- Our product, being a wellness and productivity-focused app, utilizes little automated testing as the functionality between the apps pages can mostly be tested for correctness upon success of navigating to different pages or manually checking that the app's stored values such as the user's custom checklist, can be easily accessed from both settings and the widget, for example. 
  
*(b) some part of your product cannot be tested with automated tests*
- Given the previous example, many of our app's features are tested manually instead of automatically because of the nature of the app's checklist 

Keep in mind, many test libraries support automated testing of visual interfaces, so try researching those packages before you commit to manual testing. In your sprint journal, Include a rationale justifying the use of manual testing and the exclusion of automated testing.
