# Sprint 3 Journal

## Requirements Document
- In this sprint, we changed our requirements by incorporating changes for our developer tools and coding guidelines. We have also been subscribing to a new model of committing changes within our repository and only merging those pull requests once at least 3 reviewers have approved the changes (everyone else on the team must approve changes)

## A summary of non-user-facing progress
- Our back-end progress this sprint has been on developing our app to its most minimal viable product version, in which at least the homepage, settings, manual, shop page, and connection to the widget have been completed for our in-class demonstration by the end of this week. We have made considerable progress on the basic front-facing model for Elephant which is still a work in progress.

## Manual testing in place of automated testing for part or all of your product if:
*(a) your product belongs to a category (such as gaming) where manual testing is a widely accepted industry standard OR*
- Our product, being a wellness and productivity-focused app, utilizes little automated testing as the functionality between the apps can mostly be tested for correctness upon success of navigating to different pages or manually checking that the app's stored values such as the user's custom checklist, can be easily accessed from both settings and the widget, for example. 
  
*(b) some part of your product cannot be tested with automated tests*
- Given the previous example, many of our app's features are tested manually instead of automatically because of the nature of the app's checklist 

Keep in mind, many test libraries support auomated testing of visual interfaces, so try researching those packages before you commit to manual testing. In your sprint journal, Include a rationale justifying the use of manual testing and the exclusion of automated testing.
