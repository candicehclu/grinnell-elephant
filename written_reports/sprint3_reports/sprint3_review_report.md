# Sprint 3 Review

This sprint, we focsed on the development

### How has your product improved or progressed from a customer perspective? Describe high-level features that a non-technical user could recognize and appreciate.

 We have basic functionalities of the app compared to the previous sprints where we did not have an actual working product. Moreover, in terms of aesthetics, it looks better.

### What progress have you made that is not visible to a common user?

Aside from that we focused on adding more features and app rather than backend. So, there aren't evident changes that might not be visitble to a common user. In the next sprint, we are planning on adding.
