# Sprint Journal
A document written specifically about this sprint, with answers to the prompts and questions in these instructions.
Purpose: to record written work that you produce in this sprint (outside of agile reports and requirements).

# Sprint 1

## Revise requirements based on feedback
Summarize the feedback from your reviews.
Describe the changes, if any, that you are making to your requirements, user personas, user stories, use cases, and prototype based on these reviews.
Describe your rationale in deciding what changes to make (or not make) based on the reviews.

## Create a Paper Prototype 
Add a section to your Sprint Journal with:
- One or more photos of your prototype
- You might also want to include photos of your team working on the prototype! (optional)
- Enumerate three use cases that the prototype models

## Use cases

### Use case 1
- Actor: a regular user who wants to customize their wellness message and notifications
- Goal: any regular users can trigger this use case, and this use case is connected to stories of Hughie and Emilio
- Trigger:
- Precondition: The customized message needs to be characters supported by the system, and notification settings need to conform to the capacity of the user's device
- Postcondition: User successfully creates customized wellness message and the app pushes the notification at the desired time
- Flow: (List the steps through the user interface to accomplish the goal)
- Alternative flow: (Remember to include alternative flow for recoverable situations where the use case can succeed, and for non-recoverable situations where the use case fails, Alternative flow should be a step-by-step for each alternative case, not simply a list of different cases where things could go wrong)
