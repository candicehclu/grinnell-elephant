### Review 1 (Practice)
1. **About the tester**
   - **Name:** Ellie Seehorn
   - **Occupation:** Student (CS major, 324 classmate)
   - **Reason for selection:** Ellie is a classmate in CSC 324 but not part of our team.  
   - **Date:** 02-21-2025  
   - **Time:** During class lab time (11:00 PM) and lasted about 20-30 minutes  
   - **Type of test user:** Real Stakeholder
     
2. **What roles did each team member play during the test?**  
   
| Name    | Role |
| -------- | ------- |
| Candice  | Writer    |
| Gabby | Demoing the prototype |
| Mae    | Demoing the prototype    |
|Hyeyun | Ask questions & explanation|

3. **Which user stories were activated?**  
- Karen's user story who is not good at technology was activated (partially)
- The first time user use case was activated. : The tester suggested having a quick manual or tutorial to know about this app, which was part of Karen's user stories

4. **Additional notes describing the session (e.g., observations of the test user's behavior)**  
- The tester was confused about what was going on and overall the flow of the app, which suggest we need more clear and intuitive prototype session.
  
5.  **Feedback received from the tester**
   
**Direct Feedback**

- Draw some of the collectibles (assuming user already have some)
- Unclear and insuffcient pages for unlocking the collectibles using tokens.
- Add a feature that shows how much tokens are necessary for each collectible.
- If pomodore ends, give a notification of pomodore ended
- Set intervals when you want to get reminder
- Check mark for selected feature/setting
- Be able to add task in the widget
- How pomodoro/stopwatch notifications work (user manual in the beginning, which continues to exist in a link)
- Wanted to ensure her todolist stays even she turn off the mac (i.e. does not reset) 

**Based on Questions we asked**:

- Are there any designs that are non-intuitive or confusing? If yes, what are them, and how do you think we can improve?
   -  difference between modes (confused about the difference between pomodore and stopwatch mode)
   -  Should be able to add items in the widget and in the settings
   -  Collectible pages should have number of tokens and the price, draw things on
- As a potential user, what functions of the app would make you interested in using it?
   - Different modes to choose from in one app
   - the widget part (easily accessible)
- Are there any barriers that might stop you from adopting this app?
   - only on MAC, notifications may become an issue (but if it's customizable it should be fine, and how intrusive it is)

6. **Notes on how to revise our testing procedure for the next user**
- We need to add manual to alleviate the confusion
- We need to revise the collectible pages so that it shows what collectibles user has and what are locked.
- We need to revise the collecible unlocking page so that we have more collecibltes to unlock and how many tokens are necessary and how many tokens we have
- We need to make two versions for widget: light and dark
- Being able to add new task in the widget.

7. **Not only will our prototype change, but also, we might change how we present it to users.**  
- We decided to give more background information and how the testing sessions will go to the outside stakeholder.
- We need to be more prepared for which questions we should ask. 

8. **Include one or more photos of the revised prototype where the differences from the original version can be clearly seen.**

#### Revisions

---

**Reason for change**

These changes were made to improve user engagementm accessibilty, and clarity (remove confusion) in the app. Added features in the collectiblie system create a more structured reward system and allow users to have more meaningful interaction. Widget improvements including light mode and character updates are for customization and accesibilty. The wellness checklist has personal reminders and has been renamed for clarity to focus on wellness rather than token collecting. Adding keyboard would allow more engagement during testing and new user manual is added to streamline the onboarding proccess for the app. Overall, these updates were maded to make app more intuitive, engaging, and user-friendly.

**Reason for change**

- We decided to make these changes because our app did not have basic functionalities such as closing the app page. Moreover, these revisions would help users to remove confusions such as not having next page button, close button and inconsistent token system. For example, since we had 18 for default and for the first time user, the user won't have the tokens, so we revised to 0 tokens and made it to go up every time user completes the task. Moreover, we did not have notification option before, and that would lead to ineffective app since our goal is the user to take a rest, so we decided to add notification. Overall, these revisions were made to improve navigation, clarity, and usability, making the app more structured.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4190fc63-4444-4fe2-babe-da16ba9b68e6" width="150" height="150">

**Reason for Changes**

We decided to make these changes to reduce the confusion on navigation. Moreover, we did not have the reset,resume,stop, skip button and the user was confused about after the user comes back. Therefore, without these features, the pomodore and stop watch would not make sense, since these have those functionality. Moreover, timer for when its break is required since our goal is balance between work and break, if the use does not know how many break the user has left, it would be hard to balance. Moreover, since it would be space-taking if we only have wellness mode and its tasks, and some users might want both work and wellness at the same time. THis would also help balancing work and break. Therefore, we decided to add these features to remove confusion and these help to achieve work-break balance.

#### Revision

Based on the Review 4 and Review 5 we made following changes:

**Prototype Updates**

- Edited the manual wording and add description about the new features we added.
- **Button + typing option instead of scrolling in for time settings**

***Before on the left and After on the right***

---

**Reason for Change**

We made these changes to make the app easier to navigate and blends well with the users' every day expereience. A simpler manual helps new users, so we edited the manual wording. We decided not to shorten it because that would not allow in-depth description. Typing and button options instead of scrolling options would make users to easily set timers instead of scrolling which some users could find it burdensome. Moreover, we added multiple lists so that users can add work list (to-do-list) and wellness checklist. THe notificaiton toggle and alram sounds allow more accessibility because some people might find the notification irritating and some people need sound to zone out from the work. Instead of warning for the too many tokens collected we decided to add daily max which is less intrusive to people.

## Storyboard
[CSC324_elephant_storyboard.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18933149/CSC324_elephant_storyboard.pdf)


## Cider Technique

#### Critique
What assumptions about users were identified during the critique stage?
- Assumes that users are mostly motivated by visual features
- Assumes that users use both trackpad/mouse and keyboard to navigate
- Assumes that users have no visual disabilities
- Assumes that users have a MacBook
  
#### Imagine
Which assumption(s) did you choose to expand on for this phase?
- Only visual features: users who are more hearing-oriented or with vision disabilities might be less motivated
- Modality are both trackpad/mouse and keyboard: users won't be able to use different functionalities of the app if they only have keyboard or trackpad/mouse
  
#### Design
What are your ideas for redesigning your product based on critique?
- We plan to add in sound cues when users complete tasks or unlock new avatars, which users can choose to turn off in settings
- We plan to add in features that allow navigation without keyboard, such as voice to text function for adding tasks
- A stretch goal of the project can be to add keyboard shortcuts for easier navigation

## Any Revisions to User Requirements

(3/2)
- Completed four use cases
- Added features requested by users:

- Based on our peer review and the initial app reviews from the beginning of the semester, we received feedback focused on accessibility, user experience, and ensuring that the wellness-focused incentives remained meaningful rather than just gamified engagement. One of the most significant points raised was the need for increased accessibility features, particularly in visual and interaction design. This led us to incorporate additional customization options, such as high-contrast mode and screen reader compatibility. 
- Another area of improvement for the widget's features was the expansion of stopwatch and pomodoro notifications. We integrated Pomodoro and stopwatch reminder intervals, giving users more flexibility in how they structure their breaks. The wellness break activities themselves were diversified, allowing for greater personalization so that users with different needs could customize the experience to their specific wellness goals. This ensures that the app accommodates a wide range of users, from students needing study breaks to professionals managing long work hours.
- In terms of compatibility, the feedback highlighted the importance of making the widget available across different laptop operating systems beyond MacOS. While this remains a reach goal, we documented our intent to expand accessibility beyond MacOS in future iterations. Similarly, error handling and offline functionality were strengthened—if a user loses Wi-Fi connectivity, the app will notify them and switch to a standard timer mode while queuing missed notifications for when they reconnect.
By making these changes based on reviews, we ensured that the app is not just another productivity tool but a meaningful tool that aims to integrate wellness habits into our daily routines. The feedback process played an important role in shaping a more intuitive, accessible, and effective application, reinforcing our commitment to designing a product that genuinely benefits all its users.
