# Sprint Journal
A document written specifically about this sprint, with answers to the prompts and questions in these instructions.
Purpose: to record written work that you produce in this sprint (outside of agile reports and requirements).

# Sprint 1

## Revise requirements based on feedback
Summarize the feedback from your reviews.
Describe the changes, if any, that you are making to your requirements, user personas, user stories, use cases, and prototype based on these reviews.
Describe your rationale in deciding what changes to make (or not make) based on the reviews.

## Create a Paper Prototype 
Add a section to your Sprint Journal with:
- One or more photos of your prototype
- You might also want to include photos of your team working on the prototype! (optional)
- Enumerate three use cases that the prototype models

## Test and Revise

(Refer to part 4 and part 5)

### Questions for testers

### Usability
1. Is it clear how you would set a wellness reminder? If not, what confused you?
2. Are there any designs that are non-intuitive or confusing? If yes, what are them, and how do you think we can improve?

### Emotional Engagment:
1. Did any particular feature or aspect of the interface stand out as especially enjoyable or frustrating?

### Potential Usage
1. What would motivate you to continue using this app over time?
2. Are there any barriers that might stop you from adopting this app?
3. As a potential user, what functions of the app would make you interested in using it?

### Suggestions
1. Are there any additional functions you would like to see in the app?
   
### Comparison
1. Would you prefer a simpler or more feature-rich experience? Why?

### Accesibility
1. Are there any features that could be important to some people (for accessibility ex)


### Review 1 (Practice)
1. About the tester
Peer: Ellie Seehorn </br>
Occuptation: Student (CS major, 324 classmate)</br>
The reason we chose: Ellie is a classmate of 324 and part of not our team.</br>
Date : 02-21-2025</br>
Time : During class lab time (11:00pm) and lasted about 20-30 minutes</br>
Type of the test user: 

2. What roles did each team member play during the test?
   
| Name    | Role |
| -------- | ------- |
| Candice  | Writer    |
| Gabby | Demoing the prototype |
| Mae    | Demoing the prototype    |
|Hyeyun | Ask questions & explanation|

3. Which user stories were activated?
- Karen's user story who is not good at technology was activated (partially)
- The tester suggested having a quick manual or tutorial to know about this app, which was part of Karen's user stories

4. Additional notes describing the session, e.g. observations of the test user's behavior.
- The tester was confused about what was going on, which suggest we need more clear and intuitive prototype session.
  
5. The feedback you got from the tester

#### Direct Feedback
- Draw some of the collectibles (assuming user already have some)
- Unclear and insuffcient pages for unlocking the collectibles using tokens.
- Add a feature that shows how much tokens are necessary for each collectible.
- If pomodore ends, give a notification of pomodore ended
- Set intervals when you want to get reminder
- Check mark for selected feature/setting
- Be able to add task in the widget
- How pomodoro/stopwatch notifications work (user manual in the beginning, which continues to exist in a link)
- Wanted to ensure her todolist stays even she turn off the mac (i.e. does not reset) 

#### Based on Questions we asked:
- Are there any designs that are non-intuitive or confusing? If yes, what are them, and how do you think we can improve?
   -  difference between modes (confused about the difference between pomodore and stopwatch mode)
   -  Should be able to add items in the widget and in the settings
   -  Collectible pages should have number of tokens and the price, draw things on
- As a potential user, what functions of the app would make you interested in using it?
   - Different modes to choose from in one app
   - the widget part (easily accessible)
- Are there any barriers that might stop you from adopting this app?
   - only on MAC, notifications may become an issue (but if it's customizable it should be fine, and how intrusive it is)

6. Notes on how to revise your testing procedure for the next user
- We need to add manual to alleviate the confusion
- We need to revise the collectible pages so that it shows what collectibles user has and what are locked.
- We need to revise the collecible unlocking page so that we have more collecibltes to unlock and how many tokens are necessary and how many tokens we have
- We need to make two versions for widget: light and dark
- Being able to add new task in the widget.

7. Not only will your prototype change, but also, you might choose to change the way you present it to your user.
other changes your team decided to make from your own thoughts and ideas from the testing session
other things you added to your prototype, not necessarily based on the testing session
- We decided to give more background information and how the testing sessions will go to the outside stakeholder.
- We need to be more prepared for which questions we should ask. 

8. Include one or more photos of your revised prototype where the difference between the original and revised version can be plainly seen
#### Outline of what revisions we made:
