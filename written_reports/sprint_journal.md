# Sprint Journal
A document written specifically about this sprint, with answers to the prompts and questions in these instructions.
Purpose: to record written work that you produce in this sprint (outside of agile reports and requirements).

# Sprint 1

## Revise requirements based on feedback
Summarize the feedback from your reviews.
Describe the changes, if any, that you are making to your requirements, user personas, user stories, use cases, and prototype based on these reviews.
Describe your rationale in deciding what changes to make (or not make) based on the reviews.

## Create a Paper Prototype 
Add a section to your Sprint Journal with:
- One or more photos of your prototype
- You might also want to include photos of your team working on the prototype! (optional)
- Enumerate three use cases that the prototype models

### Review 1 (Practice)
1. About the tester
Peer: Ellie Seehorn </br>
Occuptation: Student (CS major, 324 classmate)</br>
The reason we chose: Ellie is a classmate of 324 and part of not our team.</br>
Date : 02-21-2025</br>
Time : During class lab time (11:00pm) and lasted about 20-30 minutes</br>
Type of the test user: Real Stakeholder

2. What roles did each team member play during the test?
   
| Name    | Role |
| -------- | ------- |
| Candice  | Writer    |
| Gabby | Demoing the prototype |
| Mae    | Demoing the prototype    |
|Hyeyun | Ask questions & explanation|

3. Which user stories were activated?
- Karen's user story who is not good at technology was activated (partially)
- The tester suggested having a quick manual or tutorial to know about this app, which was part of Karen's user stories

4. Additional notes describing the session, e.g. observations of the test user's behavior.
- The tester was confused about what was going on, which suggest we need more clear and intuitive prototype session.
  
5. The feedback you got from the tester

#### Direct Feedback
- Draw some of the collectibles (assuming user already have some)
- Unclear and insuffcient pages for unlocking the collectibles using tokens.
- Add a feature that shows how much tokens are necessary for each collectible.
- If pomodore ends, give a notification of pomodore ended
- Set intervals when you want to get reminder
- Check mark for selected feature/setting
- Be able to add task in the widget
- How pomodoro/stopwatch notifications work (user manual in the beginning, which continues to exist in a link)
- Wanted to ensure her todolist stays even she turn off the mac (i.e. does not reset) 

#### Based on Questions we asked:
- Are there any designs that are non-intuitive or confusing? If yes, what are them, and how do you think we can improve?
   -  difference between modes (confused about the difference between pomodore and stopwatch mode)
   -  Should be able to add items in the widget and in the settings
   -  Collectible pages should have number of tokens and the price, draw things on
- As a potential user, what functions of the app would make you interested in using it?
   - Different modes to choose from in one app
   - the widget part (easily accessible)
- Are there any barriers that might stop you from adopting this app?
   - only on MAC, notifications may become an issue (but if it's customizable it should be fine, and how intrusive it is)

6. Notes on how to revise your testing procedure for the next user
- We need to add manual to alleviate the confusion
- We need to revise the collectible pages so that it shows what collectibles user has and what are locked.
- We need to revise the collecible unlocking page so that we have more collecibltes to unlock and how many tokens are necessary and how many tokens we have
- We need to make two versions for widget: light and dark
- Being able to add new task in the widget.

7. Not only will your prototype change, but also, you might choose to change the way you present it to your user.
other changes your team decided to make from your own thoughts and ideas from the testing session
other things you added to your prototype, not necessarily based on the testing session
- We decided to give more background information and how the testing sessions will go to the outside stakeholder.
- We need to be more prepared for which questions we should ask. 

8. Include one or more photos of your revised prototype where the difference between the original and revised version can be plainly seen
#### Outline of revisions made:

- Collectible pages
   - Added collectible characters on the collectibles page
   - Added locks to distinguish whether collectibles are unlocked

- Flow: instructions (affordance) -> click on pomodoro -> starts a timer -> opened and changed settings -> tried to cancel timer -> closed -> collectibles -> unlocked mystery -> tried to unlock a collectible -> custom checklist -> added and switched to checklist -> changed widget character -> change color mode 
  
5. The feedback you got from the tester

#### Direct Feedback
- Affordance missing (next/back button for manuals, scrollbar) 
- Add introductions in user manual for pomodoro, widget bar, adding the widget to the widgetbar, how the token-collectible system works
- Should be more clear on the role of user (first time/returning), can refer back to use case
- No notifications
- No pause/restart/cancel options for timer
- No update of tokens
- No update of customizable items to the widget checklist
- Lay prototype flat for stakeholder testing
- Add option in settings to pick what checklist to use 

6. Not only will your prototype change, but also, you might choose to change the way you present it to your user.

## Any Revisions to User Requirements

(02/24) 
- Based on our peer review and the initial app reviews from the beginning of the semester, we received feedback focused on accessibility, user experience, and ensuring that the wellness-focused incentives remained meaningful rather than just gamified engagement. One of the most significant points raised was the need for increased accessibility features, particularly in visual and interaction design. This led us to incorporate additional customization options, such as high-contrast mode and screen reader compatibility. 
- Another area of improvement for the widget's features was the expansion of stopwatch and pomodoro notifications. We integrated Pomodoro and stopwatch reminder intervals, giving users more flexibility in how they structure their breaks. The wellness break activities themselves were diversified, allowing for greater personalization so that users with different needs could customize the experience to their specific wellness goals. This ensures that the app accommodates a wide range of users, from students needing study breaks to professionals managing long work hours.
- In terms of compatibility, the feedback highlighted the importance of making the widget available across different laptop operating systems beyond MacOS. While this remains a reach goal, we documented our intent to expand accessibility beyond MacOS in future iterations. Similarly, error handling and offline functionality were strengthened—if a user loses Wi-Fi connectivity, the app will notify them and switch to a standard timer mode while queuing missed notifications for when they reconnect.
By making these changes based on reviews, we ensured that the app is not just another productivity tool but a meaningful tool that aims to integrate wellness habits into our daily routines. The feedback process played an important role in shaping a more intuitive, accessible, and effective application, reinforcing our commitment to designing a product that genuinely benefits all its users.
