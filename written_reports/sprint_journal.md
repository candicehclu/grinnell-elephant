# Sprint Journal
A document written specifically about this sprint, with answers to the prompts and questions in these instructions.
Purpose: to record written work that you produce in this sprint (outside of agile reports and requirements).

# Sprint 1

## Revise requirements based on feedback
Summarize the feedback from your reviews.
Describe the changes, if any, that you are making to your requirements, user personas, user stories, use cases, and prototype based on these reviews.
Describe your rationale in deciding what changes to make (or not make) based on the reviews.

## Create a Paper Prototype 
Add a section to your Sprint Journal with:
- One or more photos of your prototype
- You might also want to include photos of your team working on the prototype! (optional)
- Enumerate three use cases that the prototype models

## Use cases

### Use case 1
- Actor: a regular user who wants to customize their wellness message and notifications
- Goal: any regular users can trigger this use case, and this use case is connected to stories of Hughie and Emilio
- Trigger:
- Precondition: The customized message needs to be characters supported by the system, and notification settings need to conform to the capacity of the user's device
- Postcondition: User successfully creates customized wellness message and the app pushes the notification at the desired time
- Flow: (List the steps through the user interface to accomplish the goal)
- Alternative flow: (Remember to include alternative flow for recoverable situations where the use case can succeed, and for non-recoverable situations where the use case fails, Alternative flow should be a step-by-step for each alternative case, not simply a list of different cases where things could go wrong)


## Test and Revise

(Refer to part 4 and part 5)

### Questions for testers

### Usability
1. Is it clear how you would set a wellness reminder? If not, what confused you?
2. Are there any designs that are non-intuitive or confusing? If yes, what are them, and how do you think we can improve?

### Emotional Engagment:
1. Did any particular feature or aspect of the interface stand out as especially enjoyable or frustrating?

### Potential Usage
1. What would motivate you to continue using this app over time?
2. Are there any barriers that might stop you from adopting this app?
3. As a potential user, what functions of the app would make you interested in using it?

### Suggestions
1. Are there any additional functions you would like to see in the app?
   
### Comparison
1. Would you prefer a simpler or more feature-rich experience? Why?

### Accesibility
1. Are there any features that could be important to some people (for accessibility ex)


### Review 1
Peer: Ellie Seehorn

A narrative describing the test.
What roles did each team member play during the test?
Which user stories were activated?
Additional notes describing the session, e.g. observations of the test user's behavior.
The feedback you got from the tester
Notes on how to revise your testing procedure for the next user
Not only will your prototype change, but also, you might choose to change the way you present it to your user.
other changes your team decided to make from your own thoughts and ideas from the testing session
other things you added to your prototype, not necessarily based on the testing session

Include one or more photos of your revised prototype where the difference between the original and revised version can be plainly seen
#### Prototype
- draw some of the collectibles (assuming user already have some)
- not having enough collectible to buy
- add price for pack/collectible
- notifications for pomodoro, wellness reminders
- light mode
- check mark for selected feature/setting
- be able to add task in the widget
- how pomodoro/stopwatch notifications work (user manual in the beginning, which continues to exist in a link)

#### Questions
- Confusing: difference between modes
- Should be able to add items in the widget and in the settings
- Collectible pages should have number of tokens and the price, draw things on
- What makes you want to use: different modes to choose from, the widget part (easily accessible), todolist stays
- Barriers: only on MAC, notifications may become an issue (but if it's customizable it should be fine, and how intrusive it is)

#### Revisions
- Collectible pages
   - Added collectible characters on the collectibles page
   - Added locks to distinguish whether collectibles are unlocked
- Unlocking collectible
   - Added price
   - Added different characters to unlock on the page
- Widget
   - Made the widget character updatable (leave blank)
   - Added interface in light mode
- Wellness checklist
   - Added the option to customize wellness reminders on the widget
   - Changed title from token checklist -> wellness checklist
