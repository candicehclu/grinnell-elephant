## Sprint 1 Review Report

1. **How has your product improved or progressed from a customer perspective? Describe in terms of high-level features that a non-technical user could recognize and appreciate.**

Our team focused on creating and making changes to our paper prototype based on user feedback. Our original prototype had all of our features' goals including, but not limited to, the stopwatch and Pomodoro timer modes, tokenized collectible system, customizable wellness task list, and deciding on how the app/widget looks to the user. 

Based on various potential users' feedback, we changed the app and widget design, making it easier to navigate. We progressed our app features by including affordances, adding a simple user manual that can be accessed at any point in settings, and making the checklist more flexible for work and wellness tasks by splitting them into two different customizable lists. The user manual helps our first-time users and includes instructions for widget addition after downloading. We also worked on the collectible system within the app, designing seamless transitions and responses to user interaction (e.g., a user tries to unlock a collectible over their token count, we reject the unlock request and remind them to do more wellness tasks). Through these changes, we made our prototype more user-friendly in terms of accessible and intuitive design. We maintained our previously implemented features, in which users can set reminders and at which intervals they appear, customize their wellness tasks, and earn tokens based on wellness and productivity goals for user interaction with avatar collectibles. 

2. **What progress have you made that is not visible to a common user?**
   
Since this sprint was based on a paper prototype, our design process involved refining features and overall functionality based on user feedback. We all felt that we were able to clarify specific feature implementation and what this would look like once we get to the next stage of programming, as well as improving the intuitive nature of Elephant: A Wellness Trunk, putting ourselves in the position of various user cases and addressing their specific needs. These changes have been a huge help in getting our paper prototype to a more functional version of the app and widget overall.
