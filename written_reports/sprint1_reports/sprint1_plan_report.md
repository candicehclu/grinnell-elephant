# Sprint1 Planning Report 

## Capacity

Since this is our first sprint, there is no other sprint to compare. 
However, compared to the last two weeks, we will have more work as we need to get into familiarizing ourselves with Swift and Xcode IDE. 
Since it is our first time using Swift and Xcode, our primary focus is learning the tools (Swift, WidgetKit extension, Xcode) rather than starting implementation.

### Planned work (in study hours) estimates
1. Swift language learning (per person) + tryout in Xcode: 5 hours
2. WidgetKit extension learning (per person): 3 hours
3. Come up with collecitble design/idea for each person: 30 mins ~ 1hour per person
4. Create paper prototyping: 4 hours
5. Demoing and getting feedback from stakeholders: 1 hour per one stakeholder
6. Fix paper prototyping based on the feedbacks: 3 hours
7. Revise the user requirements: 3 hours
8. Write up for the Sprint1: 3 hours


## Goals 
**Outcomes (highlevel) we want to Achieve**
1. Learn Swift and WidgetKit Basics
2. Set Up Developer Environment
3. Design Initial App & Collectible System
4. Build & Refine Paper Prototype
5. Refine User Requirements
7. Improve Team Environment

## Assignments & Roles
This assignment shows a person's major responsiblity throughout the project (role).
| Role                         | Responsibilities |
|------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Project Manager (Hyeyun)**    | Oversees sprint progress, manages deadlines/Trello board, organizes meetings, and ensures team coordination. |
| **Lead Developer (Candice)** | Handles technical setup, coding standards, and supports development in Swift and Xcode. |
| **Lead Designer (Mae)** | Responsible for design-related tasks (e.g., character design, coloring, paper prototyping) and brainstorming app ideas. |
| **Documentation & Reporting Lead (Gabby)** | Checks sprint reports, updates documentation, and maintains other reports. |

**This table does not mean each person is entitled to their role nor they should be the only one doing the task.**
This is a guide to who will lead each task when we work together. The role might be subject to change.

## Issue Tracker
1. We have shared our Trello Elephant Development Board with our instructor and mentor, assigning tasks to each team member with clear deadlines. 
2. We also have labels to categorize the tasks and label for sprint for extra clarification. (ex: which task should be recorded in sprint journal vs. user requirement document)
3. The results of our sprint planning are tracked by our ‘Sprint1’ goals and transferred to ‘in progress’ once the task is picked up and moved over to ‘done’ once completed.
4. For the tasks that cannot be proceeded by the dependencies such as ITS tech issues, those tasks are moved to On Hold list.
