# Sprint1 Planning Report 

## Capacity

Since this is our first sprint, there is no other sprint to compare. 
However, compared to the last two weeks, we will have more work as we need to get into familiarizing ourselves with Swift and Xcode IDE. 
Since it is our first time using Swift and Xcode, our primary focus is learning the tools (Swift, WidgetKit extension, Xcode) rather than starting implementation.

### Planned work (in study hours) estimates
1. Swift language learning (per person) + tryout in Xcode: 5 hours
2. WidgetKit extension learning (per person): 3 hours
3. Come up with collecitble design/idea for each person: 30 mins ~ 1hour per person
4. Create paper prototyping: 4 hours
5. Demoing and getting feedback from stakeholders: 1 hour per one stakeholder
6. Fix paper prototyping based on the feedbacks: 3 hours


## Goals

1. Read documentation for Swift and WidgetKit (Try out couple examples in the Xcode)
2. Set up Xcode
3. Set up blank project in the github
4. Collect ideas for possible collectible system
5. Collect possible designs for the widget features
6. Team bonding activity and team feedback session
7. Fix prototype based on the reviews from at least 3 stakeholders for review of paper prototype

## Issue Tracker
We have shared our Trello Elephant Development Board with our instructor and mentor, assigning tasks to each team member with clear deadlines. 
The results of our sprint planning are tracked by our ‘Sprint1’ goals and transferred to ‘in progress’ once the task is picked up and moved over to ‘done’ once completed.
