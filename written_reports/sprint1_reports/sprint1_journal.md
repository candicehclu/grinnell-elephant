### Review 1 (Practice)
1. **About the tester**
   - **Name:** Ellie Seehorn
   - **Occupation:** Student (CS major, 324 classmates)
   - **Reason for selection:** Ellie is a classmate in CSC 324 but not part of our team.  
   - **Date:** 02-21-2025  
   - **Time:** During class lab time (11:00 PM) and lasted about 20-30 minutes  
   - **Type of test user:** Real Stakeholder
     
2. **What roles did each team member play during the test?**  
   
| Name    | Role |
| -------- | ------- |
| Candice  | Writer    |
| Gabby | Demoing the prototype |
| Mae    | Demoing the prototype    |
|Hyeyun | Ask questions & explanation|

3. **Which user stories were activated?**  
- Use Case 1: First-Time User Onboarding (Stopwatch & Pomodoro Timers)


4. **Additional notes describing the session (e.g., observations of the test user's behavior)**  
- The tester was confused about what was going on and overall the flow of the app, which suggests we need more clear and intuitive prototype session.
  
5.  **Feedback received from the tester**
   
**Direct Feedback**

- Draw some of the collectibles (assuming the user already has some)
- Unclear and insufficient pages for unlocking the collectibles using tokens.
- Add a feature that shows how many tokens are necessary for each collectible.
- If Pomodoro ends, give a notification that Pomodoro ended
- Set intervals when you want to get a reminder
- Check mark for selected feature/setting
- Be able to add a task in the widget
- How pomodoro/stopwatch notifications work (user manual in the beginning, which continues to exist in a link)
- Wanted to ensure her to-do list stays even if she turns off the Mac (i.e., does not reset) 

**Based on the Questions we asked**:

- Are there any designs that are non-intuitive or confusing? If yes, what are they, and how do you think we can improve?
   -  Difference between modes (confused about the difference between Pomodoro and stopwatch mode)
   -  Should be able to add items in the widget and the settings
   -  Collectible pages should have a number of tokens and the price, and draw things on them
- As a potential user, what functions of the app would make you interested in using it?
   - Different modes to choose from in one app
   - the widget part (easily accessible)
- Are there any barriers that might stop you from adopting this app?
   - Only on MAC, notifications may become an issue (but if it's customizable, it should be fine, and how intrusive it is)

6. **Notes on how to revise our testing procedure for the next user**
- We need to add a manual to alleviate the confusion
- We need to revise the collectible pages so that it shows what collectibles user has and what are locked.
- We need to revise the collectible unlocking page so that we have more collectibles to unlock, and how many tokens are necessary, and how many tokens we have
- We need to make two versions of the widget: light and dark
- Being able to add a new task in the widget.

7. **Not only will our prototype change, but also, we might change how we present it to users.**  
- We decided to give more background information and how the testing sessions will go to the outside stakeholders.
- We need to be more prepared for which questions we should ask. 

8. **Include one or more photos of the revised prototype where the differences from the original version can be seen.**

#### Revisions

---

**Reason for change**

These changes were made to improve user engagement, accessibility, and clarity (remove confusion) in the app. Added features in the collectible system create a more structured reward system and allow users to have more meaningful interactions. Widget improvements, including light mode and character updates, are for customization and accessibility. The wellness checklist has personal reminders and has been renamed for clarity to focus on wellness rather than token collecting. Adding a keyboard would allow more engagement during testing, and a new user manual has been added to streamline the onboarding process for the app. Overall, these updates were made to make the app more intuitive, engaging, and user-friendly.

**Reason for change**

- We decided to make these changes because our app did not have basic functionalities, such as closing the app page. Moreover, these revisions would help users to remove confusion, such as not having a next page button, a close button, and an inconsistent token system. For example, since we had 18 for default and for the first-time user, the user won't have the tokens, so we revised to 0 tokens and made it go up every time the user completes the task. Moreover, we did not have a notification option before, and that would lead to an ineffective app since our goal is for the user to take a rest, so we decided to add a notification. Overall, these revisions were made to improve navigation, clarity, and usability, making the app more structured.

There was no timer previously for a break

***After***

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4190fc63-4444-4fe2-babe-da16ba9b68e6" width="150" height="150">

**Reason for Changes**

We decided to make these changes to reduce the confusion on navigation. Moreover, we did not have the reset, resume, stop, and skip buttons, and the user was confused about after the user comes back. Therefore, without these features, the pomodoro and stop watch would not make sense, since they have that functionality. Moreover, a timer for when its break is required since our goal is to balance between work and break, if the user does not know how many breaks the user has left, it would be hard to balance. Moreover, since it would be space-taking if we only have wellness mode and its tasks, and some users might want both work and wellness at the same time. This would also help balance work and break. Therefore, we decided to add these features to remove confusion, and these help to achieve work-break balance.

***Before on the left and After on the right***

---

**Reason for Change**

We made these changes to make the app easier to navigate and blend well with the users' everyday experience. A simpler manual helps new users, so we edited the manual wording. We decided not to shorten it because that would not allow in-depth description. Typing and button options instead of scrolling options would allow users to set timers instead of scrolling, which some users could find burdensome. Moreover, we added multiple lists so that users can add a work list (to-do list) and a wellness checklist. The notification toggle and alarm sounds allow more accessibility because some people might find the notification irritating, and some people need sound to zone out from work. Instead of a warning for the too many tokens collected, we decided to add a daily max, which is less intrusive to people.

## Storyboard
[CSC324_elephant_storyboard.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18933149/CSC324_elephant_storyboard.pdf)


## Cider Technique

#### Critique
What assumptions about users were identified during the critique stage?
- Assumes that users are mostly motivated by visual features
- Assumes that users use both the trackpad/mouse and keyboard to navigate
- Assumes that users have no visual disabilities
- Assumes that users have a MacBook
  
#### Imagine
Which assumption(s) did you choose to expand on for this phase?
- Only visual features: users who are more hearing-oriented or with vision disabilities might be less motivated
- Modality is both trackpad/mouse and keyboard: users won't be able to use different functionalities of the app if they only have a keyboard or trackpad/mouse
  
#### Design
What are your ideas for redesigning your product based on the critique?
- We plan to add in sound cues when users complete tasks or unlock new avatars, which users can choose to turn off in settings
- We plan to add features that allow navigation without keyboard, such as a voice-to-text function for adding tasks
- A stretch goal of the project can be to add keyboard shortcuts for easier navigation

## Any Revisions to User Requirements

1. 
***Summary of Feedback***

Based on our peer review and the initial app reviews from the beginning of the semester, we received feedback focused on accessibility, user experience, and ensuring that the wellness-focused incentives remained meaningful rather than just gamified engagement. One of the most significant points raised was the need for increased accessibility features, particularly in visual and interaction design.

2. Added the user case 

3. Edited the use case #2
   - Added two different flows: adding a task on the widget interface & adding a task from the in-app settings
   - Added alternative flow when the app crashes

4. Added features requested by users:
   - Rotating list option in the Pomodoro mode
   - User manual and explanation of alternative use of the app (using it for task management instead of wellness tasks), which pops up when the user first opens the app and remains accessible through a question mark button in the app interface
   - Accessibility features such as color modes and higher readability mode
   - Sound cues and option to turn them off in settings
5. Updated and reorganized the main features section of the requirements document to include the following:
   - Description of components for both app and widget interface
   - Description of the setting options allowed for the widget
   - Description of different components of the app, including the shop, the user manual, and the token-collectible system
6. Updated list of stretch goals to include the following:
   - Keyboard shortcuts to allow navigation without a trackpad/mouse
   - Option for widget to exist as an independent window on the desktop instead of in the sidebar
